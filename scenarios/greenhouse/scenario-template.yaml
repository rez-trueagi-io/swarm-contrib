  Curate flower varieties
creative: false
seed: 0
objectives:
  - teaser: Flower curation
    goal:
      - Distribute every type of flower into
        the planter boxes in the greenhouse.
        There are just enough "planter box receptacles"
        to accommodate each variety.
      - Do not pick any mushrooms!
      - "Hint: examine your recipes for a way to simplify bookkeeping..."

    teaser: Wait patiently
    goal:
      - Wait patiently until the garden is populated. Then you
        will be able to `grab` treads and go to work!
